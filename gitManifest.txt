Basic Git Flow

assumption - you are on master
1. git checkout -b "my_cool_feature"
2. code like a crazy monkey and commit using ` git commit -am "my cool feature notes" `
    this step shouldn't take more then two three days
    and dont include too many code changes here at once
3. git checkout master
4. git pull -r origin master (to get the most updated master code)
5. git checkout my_cool_feature (to return to your branch)
6. git rebase master
7. if you have conflicts , resolve them together with the coder you conflicted with
8. stop , relax and do ` git diff master `
9. carefully review all your changes, make sure you know every one of them
10. notify deploy in the DevTeam
11. git checkout master
12. git rebase my_cool_feature
13. git push origin master
14. Deploy via jenkins




Resolving conflict using rebase
1. identify your conflicts
2. resolve them one by one, talk to the conflicts developer
3. git add path_to/file/resolved
4. git rebase --continue
5. repeat until no conflict messages
6. if it's too long, you can always git rebase --abort
